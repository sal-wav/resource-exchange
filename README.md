# Resource Exchange

[live site](https://resource-exchange-app.herokuapp.com/)

*Resource Exchange* reimagines Kickstarter's project-backing structure as a community-oriented organizational tool to provide support for people who need it. Anyone can organize a fund to support themselves, people they know, or the community as a whole. Organizers have the option of posting exchanges, so contributors may receive something in return.
