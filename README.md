# Resource Exchange

[live site](https://resource-exchange-app.herokuapp.com/)

*Resource Exchange* reimagines Kickstarter's project-backing structure as a community-oriented organizational tool to provide support for people who need it. Anyone can organize a fund to support themselves, people they know, or the community as a whole. Organizers have the option of posting exchanges, so contributors may receive something in return.

### Features

__User authentication__
* Users can securely create an account using our login and logout feature. melodie uses hash passwords so that no plain text passwords are ever stored in the database. melodie also uses various middleware functions when processing request and responses so that we know a user is who they say they are. Certain routes also require user authenication for pages to be accessed
